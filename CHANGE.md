# Changes applied (summary)

This commit/update includes frontend cleanup, shared UI assets, and a minimal Node.js server to persist judge results.

Frontend (replacements/additions)
- Replaced: `frontend/About/index.html`
  - Removed old commented header; made headings semantic.
  - Uses `/frontend/style.css` and `/frontend/script.js`.
  - Buttons updated to call `labsimAddObservation(...)` and `exportResultsCSV()`.
- Added/Updated: `frontend/style.css`
  - Global navbar styles, responsive embed wrapper, button and focus styles, judge/visitor visibility helpers, basic container/card styles.
- Added/Updated: `frontend/script.js`
  - Consolidated shared UI helpers:
    - Navbar injection with Judge/Visitor toggle.
    - Keyboard accessibility for `.card[tabindex]`.
    - Result capture helpers:
      - `window.labsimAddObservation(label, value)`
      - `window.exportResultsCSV(filename)`
    - Automatic repair of invalid `<audio>` tags pointing to YouTube by replacing them with responsive iframe embeds.

Server (new)
- Added: `server.js`
  - Express static server that serves `/frontend` and `/multimedia`.
  - API endpoints:
    - POST /api/results — append JSON result to data/results.json
    - GET /api/results — retrieve stored results
    - GET /api/results.csv — download results as CSV
- Added: `package.json` to install dependencies and run the server.

Notes & next steps
- Sweep repo for duplicated inline scripts and replace with `<script src="/frontend/script.js"></script>` on each page. I updated the active About page; other pages may still include inline ripple/animation code — run a search for "ripple", duplicate script blocks, or `audio src="youtube"` and point them to the shared script.
- Consider persisting results client-side (localStorage) and/or use the provided /api/results POST endpoint to centralize judge scoring.
- For production deployment, secure the API endpoints and validate inputs. Consider authentication if needed.
- Optional enhancements: Chart.js visualization, JSON-driven experiment templates, PWA offline caching.

How to run the server locally
1. In repository root run:
   - npm install
   - npm start
2. Open http://localhost:3000/frontend/index.html

If you want, I will:
- sweep repository for duplicate inline scripts and convert them to imports of /frontend/script.js (automated replacements),
- or add an example client-side snippet that POSTs results to /api/results from the UI.

Which should I do next? (sweep or example POST client).
